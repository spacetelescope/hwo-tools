# Basic EXOSIMS Parameter File #
################################

# Each section will be broken up into 3 sections: Foreground, Background, and Unused (where applicable).
# Foreground parameters are those we want easily accessible and modifiable by the user.
# Background parameters are those that are necessary for the simulation to run, but are not likely to be changed by the user.
# Unused parameters are those that are not currently being used in the EXOSIMS run, but exist in the documentation.
# If further questions arise, please refer to the EXOSIMS documentation: https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Define Observing Mode ####
    #See OpticalSystem Module for more details on observingModes, scienceInstruments, and starlightSuppressionSystems: (https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opticalsystem.html#opticalsystem)
  # Foreground:
    ppFact: 0.29 # [0,1], post-processing contrast factor. Represents much you can reduce the residual speckle noise by post-processing.
    #ppFact = 0.1 -> "we can reduce the residual speckle noise by one order of magnitude via post-processing"
    #Post-processing contrast factor, between 0 and 1: either a scalar for constant gain, or a two-column array for separation-dependent gain, where the first column contains the angular separation in units of arcsec. May be data or FITS filename. Default value is 1.
    pupilDiam: 7.87 # Entrance pupil diameter in meters
    ppFact: 0.29 # [0,1], post-processing contrast factor. Represents much you can reduce the residual speckle noise by post-processing.
    #ppFact = 0.1 -> "we can reduce the residual speckle noise by one order of magnitude via post-processing"
    #Post-processing contrast factor, between 0 and 1: either a scalar for constant gain, or a two-column array for separation-dependent gain, where the first column contains the angular separation in units of arcsec. May be data or FITS filename. Default value is 1.
    pupilDiam: 7.87 # Entrance pupil diameter in meters
    observingModes:
    - SNR: 7.0 #Signal-to-noise ratio requirement for all observations
      timeMultiplier: 1.1 #integration time multiplier applied for this mode. Ex: if this mode requires 2 full rolls per observation, set to 2. 

  # Background:
      detectionMode: true #An observing mode is the combination of a science instrument with a starlight suppression system along with rules for determining integration times.
          #One observing mode in the optical system must be tagged as the default detection mode, this is done by setting the detectionMode attribute to true. If no observing mode is tagged as the detection mode, the first observing mode is set as the detection mode.
      instName: "CONF_NF_Imager" #Must match with the name of a defined Science Instrument
      systName: "coronagraph" #Must match with the name of a defined Starlight Suppression System.
    minComp: 0 #Minimum completeness for inclusion in target list, defaults to 0.1
    # Completeness defined as "the probability of a planet falling outside a telescope's centreal obscuration, thus becoming potentially observable."
    # "Single-visit completeness is determined by the assumption that an exoplanet is observable if its angular separation from its star is greater than the observatory’s inner working angle (IWA) and less than the observatory’s outer working angle (OWA) while also being illuminated such that the difference in brightness between the star and planet (∆mag) is below a limiting value (∆mag0)."
    obscurFac: 0.1211489507256436 #Obscuration factor due to secondary mirror and spiders. Defaults to 0.1
    shapeFac: 0.7853981633974483 #Shape factor of the unobscured pupil area, so that shapeFac * pupilDiam**2 * (1-obscurFac) = pupilArea 
    filterBinaries: false #bool, Remove all binary stars or stars with known close companions from target list
    keepStarCatalog: true #bool, Keep star catalog object as attribute after TargetList is built

#### Define science instrument parameters ####
    scienceInstruments:
  # Foreground:
    - name: CONF_NF_Imager
      ##FoV: 3.5 #Angular half-field of view (FOV radius), units of arcsec
      #output error from main.py: UserWarning: Input FoV (3.5 arcsec) is larger than FoV computed from pixelScale (3.35 arcsec) for instrument CONF_NF_Imager. This feels like a mistkae.
      FoV: 3.35

#### Define starlight suppression system parameters ####
  # Foreground:
    starlightSuppressionSystems:
    - name: coronagraph
      lam: 1000.0 #central wavelength in units of nm
      BW: 0.2 #bandwidth fraction, such that lam * BW = deltaLam
      ohTime: 0.0 #overhead time for all integrations in units of days
      occulter: false #does the system have an occulter?
      core_area: 2.26 #area of photometric aperture, in units of input_angle_units, used to compute core_thruput and core_mean_intensity
      IWA: 0.1767766952966369 #inner wroking angle, units of arcsec
      OWA: 45.078057300642406 #outer working angle, units of arcsec
      input_angle_units: LAMBDA/D #angle unit to assume for all starlight suppression system inputs that are angles

  # Background:
      #from EXOSIMS readthedocs: When using input files for occ_trans, core_thruput, core_contrast, core_mean_intensity, or core_area, the file may be a FITS file or a CSV file. For occ_trans, core_thruput, core_contrast, and core_area, FITS files must contain two rows (or columns) where the first represents angular separation and the second represents the parameter value. The FITS header should specify the angular separation unit in keyword UNITS which should either be unitless or LAMBDA/D for 
      #units or contain a string that is parsable as an astropy length unit (https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/format.html). If the keyword does not exist, units of input_angle_units will be assumed. For CSV files, the angular separation must be in a column with header csv_angsep_colname and the parameter value must be in a column with a header that is exactly the same as the keyword name (i.e., occ_trans, etc.). There is not a required order for the columns in a CSV file, and other columns may also be present in the same file. For CSV files, the angular separation unit is set by key input_angle_units.
      occ_trans: $HWOTOOLS_DIR/coron_imaging/exosims_wrapper/occ_trans.fits
      #Intensity transmission of extended background sources such as zodiacal light, parametrized by wavelength and angular separation. This includes the pupil mask, occulter, Lyot stop and polarizer. Input values may be scalars or full paths to files containing input data to an interpolant. The top-level default defaults to 0.2      
      #this input fits file has columns of: angular separation and occulter transmission
      core_thruput: $HWOTOOLS_DIR/coron_imaging/exosims_wrapper/core_thruput.fits
      #System throughput in a given photometric aperture of the planet PSF core, parametrized by wavelength and angular separation
      #this input fits file has columns of: angular separation and core throughput
      core_mean_intensity: $HWOTOOLS_DIR/coron_imaging/exosims_wrapper/core_mean_intensity.fits
      #Mean starlight residual normalized intensity per pixel of the simulated PSF
      #Totcal core intensity computed as core_mean_intensity * number of intensity map pixels in the photometric aperture (determined from core_platescale and core_area). 
      #If not specified, then the total core intensity is computed as core_contrast * core_thruput
      ################################################################################
      #Note: We need to define core_platescale if we want to use core_mean_intensity.#
      ################################################################################
      # for now, I'm going to assume core_platescale = pixelscale ... why would this NOT be the case?
      core_platescale: 6.55e-3

  # Unused:
    # deltaLam: Quantity, Bandwidth in units of nm.
    # contrast_floor: float, an absolute limit on achievable core_contrast
    # core_platescale_units: str, unit angle to assume for core_platescale, defaults to LAMBDA/D
    # core_platescale: float, pixel scale (angular extent of each pixel) for the coronagraph PSF and intensity maps
        # This must be set if using core_mean_intensity and setting a scalar input or using a CSV file. If reading from a FITS file, the value can be encoded in the header
    # csv_angsep_colname: str, Column name to use for the angular separation column for CSV data for all files
    # core_area: callable, Area of the photometric aperture used to compute core_thruput and core_mean_itensity, parametrized by wavelength and angular separation
    # core_contrast: callable, System contrast = mean_intensity / PSF_peak, parametrized by wavelength and angular separation. Input values may be scalars or full paths to files containing input data to an interpolant. Default values are only populated in cases where core_mean_intensity is None
